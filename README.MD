# Odin Recipes Website

This project is a simple HTML website showcasing recipes, developed as part of the Odin Project to build web development skills.

## Live Site
[Odin Recipes](https://kennethalee.github.io/odin-recipes)

## Features
- Homepage linking to recipe pages.
- Each recipe page includes:
  - Recipe title.
  - Dish image.
  - Ingredients list.
  - Step-by-step instructions.

## Tools
- **HTML**: For content structure.
- **CSS** (Planned): For styling and layout.

## Objective
Create a site that:
1. Lists recipes on a homepage.
2. Links to detailed recipe pages.
3. Reinforces basic HTML skills.

## Insights
- Gained HTML layout and linking experience.
- Improved understanding of semantic tags and accessibility.
- Learned to deploy on GitHub Pages.

## Future Plans
- Add CSS for better visuals.
- Implement responsive design.
- Expand recipe variety and structure.

## Personal Thoughts
- I had problems implementing the images. It took a fairly long time for me to fix the issue, but I figured it out (details are in the activity tab).
- Other than that, it was pretty straightforward, and Iâ€™m looking forward to adding more features and decorations.
