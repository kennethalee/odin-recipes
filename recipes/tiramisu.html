    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tiramisu is a classic Italian dessert known for its rich layers of 
        coffee-soaked ladyfingers, velvety mascarpone cream, and a dusting of 
        cocoa powder. The delicate balance of flavors, combining the boldness 
        of espresso with the creamy sweetness of mascarpone, creates a 
        sophisticated yet indulgent treat. Perfect for special occasions or 
        as a luxurious everyday dessert, tiramisu embodies the art of Italian 
        culinary elegance.

        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup strong brewed espresso (cooled)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coffee liqueur (optional)</li>
        <li>1 package ladyfinger biscuits (savoiardi)</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Prepare the espresso</b>: Brew strong espresso and let it cool. 
            Mix with coffee liqueur if using.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Whisk egg yolks</b>: In a bowl, whisk egg yolks with sugar until 
            pale and creamy. Add mascarpone and vanilla extract, mixing until 
            smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Whip egg whites</b>: In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until 
            stiff peaks form. Gently fold into the mascarpone mixture for a 
            light, airy texture
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Dip the ladyfingers</b>: Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the 
            cooled espresso mixture, ensuring they are coated but not soggy.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Layer the tiramisu</b>: In a rectangular dish, arrange a layer 
            of dipped ladyfingers. Spread half of the mascarpone mixture evenly 
            over them. Repeat with another layer of ladyfingers and the 
            remaining mascarpone mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Dust with cocoa</b>: Generously sift cocoa powder over the top 
            layer.

        <li>
            <b>Chill</b>: Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, 
            preferably overnight, to let the flavors meld.
