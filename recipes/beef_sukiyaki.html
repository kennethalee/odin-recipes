    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beef Sukiyaki is a classic Japanese hotpot dish that combines thinly 
        sliced beef with an assortment of vegetables, tofu, and noodles 
        simmered in a sweet-savory broth made from soy sauce, sugar, and mirin. 
        Served in a communal pot, sukiyaki brings warmth and comfort, perfect 
        for sharing with family or friends. The tender beef and hearty 
        vegetables absorb the flavorful broth, creating a harmonious balance 
        of umami and sweetness, often accompanied by a raw egg for dipping.
